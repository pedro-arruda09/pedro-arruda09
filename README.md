- 👋 Hi, I’m @pedro-arruda09
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new methods on how to make people's life easier and better. Besides that, I'm open to learn any programming language if needed.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NodeJS, SQL, AngularJS and almost anything involved with JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that aggregates in my development as a student of technology.
- 📧 You can reach me at pedroarruda10005@gmail.com
